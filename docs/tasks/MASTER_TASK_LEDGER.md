# MASTER TASK LEDGER — 10,000 sequential tasks

**Law:** execute strictly in numeric order. Task N+1 starts only when task N is complete.
Never jump to a later task. If blocked, record the blocker and stop.

Full machine-readable ledger: `MASTER_TASK_LEDGER.jsonl` (one task per line).
Live pointer: `TASK_STATE.json` (`next_task` = the only task allowed to start).

## First 25 tasks (detail)

### T-00001 — Mission lock + sequential execution law  `[done]`
**Goal:** Confirm the project mission and create the binding no-skip task law.
**Instructions:**
- Read START_HERE.md, PROJECT_MANIFEST.yaml, AI_CONSTITUTION.md, ADR-0035, ADR-0036.
- Create docs/tasks/GOALS.md with the mission, pillars, and execution law.
- Record that tasks execute strictly in numeric order (task N+1 only after N done).
**Acceptance:**
- docs/tasks/GOALS.md exists and states the no-skip rule.

### T-00002 — Environment + baseline verification  `[done]`
**Goal:** Prove the toolchain and all existing smoke suites are green before new work.
**Instructions:**
- Install/verify python deps (pip install -e code/aiosh-mcp) and node deps.
- Run all existing smokes: classifier, mcp, pentest, sandbox, demo, cli bash.
- Record PASS output in docs/tasks/evidence/T-00002-baseline.md.
**Acceptance:**
- All baseline suites PASS; evidence captured.

### T-00003 — Generate canonical 10,000-task ledger  `[done]`
**Goal:** Create the machine-readable sequential ledger and live task pointer.
**Instructions:**
- Run tools/generate_master_tasks.py to produce MASTER_TASK_LEDGER.jsonl + TASK_STATE.json.
- Verify exactly 10,000 tasks, IDs T-00001..T-10000, each with instructions + acceptance.

**Acceptance:**
- Ledger has 10,000 well-formed tasks; pointer file exists.

### T-00004 — Create fail-fast CI runner  `[ready]`
**Goal:** Give the project one command that runs every smoke suite sequentially and fails loudly.
**Instructions:**
- Create ci/run_all_smokes.sh invoking each suite in order with set -euo pipefail.

### T-00005 — Task-state completion tool  `[pending]`
**Goal:** Provide a single command to mark the active task complete and advance the pointer.
**Instructions:**
- Create tools/complete_task.py <task_id>: validate task_id == current next_task.

**Goal:** Make the task ledger discoverable from the repo entry points.
