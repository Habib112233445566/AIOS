"""Generate the canonical 10,000-task sequential master ledger.

Outputs:
  docs/tasks/MASTER_TASK_LEDGER.jsonl   — one task per line (full detail)
  docs/tasks/MASTER_TASK_LEDGER.md      — human index (laws + first tasks + phase map)
  docs/tasks/TASK_STATE.json            — live pointer: next task, completed set

Rules encoded in every task:
  - strict numeric order; a task may start only when task_id-1 is done
  - research before implementation (REP binding)
  - every implementation task requires a failing test first where possible
  - every task lists acceptance criteria; evidence must be recorded
